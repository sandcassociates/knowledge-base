We keep most of our work in two separate places: Dropbox and ProjectWise Explorer. 

## ProjectWise 

S&C uses ProjectWise as our server for [ITD] [CAD] work. ITD grants each employee access to ITD projects that we are working on. Each [prime] and [sub] consulting firm works off ProjectWise to store and open CAD files. Generally, the only files S&C stores on ProjectWise is our CAD files. All our other documents live in Dropbox.

## Dropbox

We use Dropbox as our internal storage server. If you don't already [have access], reach out to your supervisor to get in. All of S&C's internal documents are stored here. We generally don't store any CAD files in Dropbox; however, we do store [plan sheet] PDF prints in Dropbox. 

## Navigating Dropbox

After you download Dropbox, you'll need to request access to your project folders and our shared resource folders. Project folders generally all have the same sub-folder structure and are named `PROJECT NUMBER PROJECT NAME`. For example, `21-1092 SH-16 Phase 3` or `22-1069 I-90 Spokane to US 95`. All project folders are copied from the `PROJECT FILE (copy for each project)` master file, also located in Dropbox.

The **Engineering Reference Docs** folder includes a number of helpful reference materials.

For S&C-specific reference materials, check out **Engineering Reference Docs** > **Project Forms and Check Lists** > **S&C forms**. This file includes a number of templates, including S&C's letterhead and style guide.

In **Engineering Reference Docs** > **S&C Knowledge Library**, you'll find Word doc copies of much of the content on this site. However, in the **Templates** folder, you'll find a few backup templates for our projects (for example, the SWPPP Quantities Excel template).
