**Definitions**

**Utility Files**

Utility files are used to map existing utilities in the project area and
guide the design of the project. Utility files are created from data
provided by utility companies and survey data from the field. It is
necessary to incorporate both to document the utilities.

**SWPP Files**

Needs definition

**2D Drainage Files**

Needs definition

**Working File**

Working files are files that you are working on and aren't ready for
others to reference or view.

**Seed file**

**ZBase File**
Also called a container file

**Alignment line**
Runs through the middle of a road, has stationing numbers on it

**Definitions**

Below are definitions of the sheet creation process components.

**Border file** --- S&C and discipline specific of project-specific
border file, often has multiple border files (SWPP, Utility, profile,
drainage, etc.) (does this mean one border file has multiple border
files within it?)

**Design file** --- Where CAD work is done. Either 2D or 3D. Discipline
specific, so if designing utilities, only utilities go in this file.

**Sheet cuts** --- The limits of a sheet, often defined by the project
civil prime. We usually try to have the same limits as the sheets
defined by the project civil prime.

**Sheet file** --- The file created after running the drawing production
tool. (What's the drawing production tool?) Only annotations should be
done in the Sheet files. **Sheet files should only contain the Border
file and ZBase file. The Border file shouldn't be live referenced.**

**Path Element** --- Project Alignment (What does this mean?)

**ZBase file** --- The container file that all references you want
displayed on your sheets should be referenced into. This is where you
will set the layers you want displayed. **No design should be done in
the ZBase file.**
