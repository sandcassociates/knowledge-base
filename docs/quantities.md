# Quantities
When we talk about "quantities" at S&C, we're referring to the actual quantity of a given [BMP](/docs/glossary#bmp) or other resource that is required for project completion. We calculate the amount of BMP needed in the design file, record the amount and stationing (location) in an Excel spreadsheet, then copy the amount and stationing over to the corresponding plan sheets.
