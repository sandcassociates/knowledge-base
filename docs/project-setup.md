# Project Setup
***
Getting a new project ready to work on usually means setting up the files you'll be working on over the course of the project. Once you've set up your files, you can begin the actual [design] work.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

When you start a new project, you'll need to:

- [X] Copy and paste the PROJECT FILE in Dropbox, then rename it to your project

- [X] Create a new design file, either [2D] or [3D] 

- [X] Create new [plan sheets]

- [X] Get the [Print Set] (pset) ready
