# Plan Sheets
Plan sheets are the actual files we deliver to the prime that shows our design work. Although we create plan sheets in OpenRoads Designer, we "print" them via a print set to PDF and then deliver the PDF versions to the prime for review and eventual distribution to the onsite construction crews.

To prepare plan sheets, you'll need to set up the [plan sheet files], [create the pset], attach the border file and container file, add bubble call outs and quantity annotations, and finally print the plan sheets to PDF via the pset.
