S&C has specific naming conventions for files separate from CAD files. This document explains the differences of each and the necessary rules to follow. When naming files the goal is to be consistent, straight forward, and create a well thought out file name that makes sense to both you and other team members.

File names should have meaning. File names are the fastest way to identify what is inside a file and how it differs from similar files.

Tips when naming a file:

* Be descriptive
* Be consistent
* Be short, aim for less than 25 characters including spaces
* Avoid special characters and periods
* Use dates

## Idaho Transportation Department (ITD) Projects

S&C names its files based upon the ITD key number, the description of the file, the milestone deliverable (if applicable) and the date.  The following shows a few typical naming structures:

    20675 UTILITY LTR FD 01102025.docx
    20675 SWPP SHEETS PD 02102025.pdf
    20675 SWPP SHEETS PSE 03102025.pdf

The date is listed in a MM/DD/YYYY format. Spaces are used to distinguish different parts of the name.

Below are key milestones typical on an ITD project:

* PD - Preliminary  Design
* ID - Intermediate Design 
* FD - Final Design
* PSE - Plans, Specifications, and Estimate 

## Non-Idaho Transportation Department Projects

S&C names its files based upon the S&C job number, the description of the file, and the date. The following shows a few the typical naming structures:

    241085 TWIN CRKS MEMO 02152025.docx
	241007 ACORE CONTRACT 07112024.pdf

The date is listed in a MM/DD/YYYY format.  Spaces are used to distinguish different parts of the name.
